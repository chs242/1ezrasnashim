At the age of 13 Eliana was diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder called CRPS, which eventually developed into a localized form of fibromyalgia. She struggled with the diagnosis for a long time, until a role model explained to her the biological aspect of such conditions. The more Elianna learned the more she realized she wanted a future in the medical world. She had to wait until she was 16 before she could get her EMT license and join an EMS agency, which for Elianna was the logical next step. By the time she turned 16 Elianna was already researching colleges, and that’s when she discovered that Stern was in the process of creating an Ezras Nashim branch. Being able to use her EMT license surrounded by other women who share the same values as her was all the persuasion Elianna needed, and the rest, as they say, is history.

In addition to the work Elianna does for Ezras Nashim, she also works as an EMT in her hometown of Bergenfield, NJ, at the Bergenfield Volunteer Ambulance Corp.\
We are honored and proud to have such a hard-working and devoted member on the Ezras Nashim team. Thank you, Elianna, for all the good that you do!
