Nana does volunteer work for the Central Park Medical Unit, as well as for Ezras Nashim. Nana picks up as many shifts as her busy schedule will allow, and on Shabbos she always tries to be on call for Ezras Nashim. Nana says most calls nowadays are related to COVID-19. According to new guidelines most people with mild symptoms are advised to stay home and monitor their symptoms closely, however she and her team are still kept busy transporting the severely ill to hospitals. We’re so proud and grateful to have such a devoted member on the Ezras Nashim team, especially in these critical times as we continue battling the novel coronavirus. Check out the link in our bio to watch the news interview Nana had with MSNBC!
