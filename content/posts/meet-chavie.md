“The first thing I heard when I walked in was, "I’m pushing, I'm pushing!”\
I thought to myself, is this really happening? Before I knew it the baby was in my hands. It felt surreal to be such a big part of the mother and baby's life. As I cleaned and wrapped up the baby, I couldn't help but marvel at how lucky I was to be there in the right place at the right time. This wasn’t the first time I helped a woman deliver a child in her bathroom, but that feeling of awe and amazement never gets old. I want to do this for the rest of my life.”
