  Ezras Nashim. Our mission. Our purpose and our commitment to the community.


  Ezras Nashim was founded on the belief that no woman should have to hesitate calling for emergency medical care. Primarily intended for women experiencing emergency labor or OB/GYN emergencies, it soon became apparent that the needs of the community surpassed that of just gynecological services. Beyond that, Ezras Nashim participates in many ways to serve communities. 


  Coronavirus community care: During the Coronavirus pandemic, our EMT staff was responding to calls 24/7 and enabling the sick to receive treatment in their own homes, as many were very reluctant to go to hospitals for care. The elderly suffering from the virus were especially hesitant about checking into hospitals for treatment, knowing they would be alone and isolated from their families and advocates, due to Covid restrictions. 


  Instead, they called us.


  We donned PPE and went to the homes of those suffering from the virus, checked their vitals, and provided them with oxygen. We even taught their adult children how to administer oxygen, and left our own tanks with them so they could continue providing care for their parents at home. We also invited men and women to our base and taught them how to administer oxygen to their loved ones, also lending them own oxygen tanks so they could help their ailing family members.


  This is just one example of how committed Ezras Nashim is to support everyone in our communities.  


  Coronavirus community educational services: At Ezras Nashim we believe prevention is key, which is why the Home Visit Program is such a vital part of our organization.


  When responding to certain calls our EMTs often observe a situation in which they determine the patient would benefit from consistent monitoring. Whether these women often experience sudden spikes in their blood pressure or frequently forget to take their medications, checking in on them weekly, monitoring their vitals and ensuring they’re taking their medications properly, prevents them from becoming frequent callers for emergency medical care. 


  Our Home Visit Program also services elderly & homebound women by request, filling in the gaps in the healthcare system by sending EMTs weekly to monitor their vitals, blood pressure, oxygen levels, etc.. Checking in on these women once or twice a week helps avoid emergency situations, and very often it gives our EMTs the opportunity to prevent a life-threatening emergency by transferring these women to hospitals for care before the situation escalates.


  Ezras Nashim EMT are fully certified by the official NYS EMT course to ensure high quality care: To become certified our EMTs train for 180 hours, over a span of 3-6 months. Half that time is spent skill training, and the other half is spent attending online classes and covering reading materials.


  All Ezras Nashim EMTs are required to attend additional training every two weeks to ensure their skills are always up-to-date and that they really know their stuff. These trainings include emergency birth classes, medication classes, splinting classes, etc.. Our members are consistently reviewing and practicing their skills. 


  Commitment to the next generation: Ezras Nashim empowers women who have a passion for medicine and want to help their communities, but are held back from pursuing careers in the medical field by circumstances in their lives. For example, for women with large families of young children becoming a doctor or nurse can be unattainable and granting them the opportunity to become EMTs is realistic and empowering. 


  At Ezras Nashim we also prioritize training the young generation. We consistently host street fairs and other gatherings, teaching children how to do perform CPR on adults, on children, and on infants, so that if they ever find themselves in an emergency situation, be it a parent who collapses or a sibling choking, they are prepared to take charge and know not only to call for help, but also the basics of CPR, First Aid, or how to perform the Heimlich Maneuver, while they wait for help to arrive. 


  We believe adults and children alike should learn these life-saving skills, and that by granting them opportunities to learn we are making the world a safer and better place for everyone.


  We value diversity in our EMT staff and the communities we serve: Ezras Nashim takes great pride in the diversity of our EMTs. Any woman wishing to donate her time to help other women is welcome. Our members are Jewish, non-Jewish, religious, non-religious, immigrants, and from many different ethnic backgrounds and countries. Our volunteers come in all types and stripes and unite under the mission of helping women in need, and that is what makes Ezras Nashim so beautiful.


  We ask for your help us realize our mission, our purpose and our commitment to the community with professionalism and compassion.
